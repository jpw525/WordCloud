# WordCloud

This is example code from a text analysis porject.

If you have panel data (multiple entries per case) you will need to transform you data to be one column per case. See my column merger script to combine all text entries to one column (can be useful if you are analyzing multiple entries on the same topic and are interested in overall responses, especially if there are few words per entry).

This script pulls words from .csv files, removes stop words and creates a word cloud.
